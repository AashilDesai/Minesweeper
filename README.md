# Minesweeper
A fully functioning game (including a JGraphics GUI) of Minesweeper built in Java. The player is presented a grid and clicking on a square reveals whether the square is a bomb (resulting in a loss), or how many bombs are adjacent to the selected square. The player can also flag certain squares (making them light up a different color) if the player suspects they are bombs.
